Hi I hope this message finds you well.

I have an excel assignment which I would like to seek some help. The excel contains a list of orders (indicated by order ID) of various products from a store and I'm supposed to provide an analysis. I have noticed that the table includes multiple rows of the same order ID but with different products. 

I have a hypothesis that I would like to recommend bundling products to encourage sales. I would like to find out what products are commonly bougtht with Copiers. In other words, I would like the table to only show Order IDs which have bought at least 1 Copier. It should also show the other products bought under these Order IDs. I tried "Group By" in Power Query but it did not work. 

May I know how much would it cost for your coaching on this? I would prefer a step by step guide in a word/ppt document with screenshots. 

Thank you.
